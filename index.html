              <h3>Coffee App</h3>
              <p><b>Education | 2017</b></p>
              <br>
              <p>For this project, students were tasked with designing one feature of a mobile app for a coffee retailer, using either a prexisting brand or a fictional one. I chose to design for Counter Culture Coffee, a local roaster and distributor from Durham, NC, with a national retail network.</p>
              <br>
              <p>We began the design process by researching the brand character, target audience and creating a SWOT (Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities, Threats) analysis of the product/company. From this initial research phase, it was clear that the company was driven by a creative and meticulous approach to coffee making. Their attention to detail and refined packaging are reflections of their brand ethos, which permeates through all aspects of their business.</p>
              <br>
              <p>Where I felt there was room for improvement was in their ability to attract new customers, specifically those without a preexisting palette who would have difficulty distinguishing between the vast array of flavors and types of coffee offered. In attempts to solve this issue, I imagined the “Find My Coffee” app, which helps customers decide which coffee to buy based on their taste preferences. By answering a series of easy, yes-or-no questions the customer is able to hone in on a variety of coffee that suits them, without feeling put off by overwhelming options. Additionally, the bright colors used in the design serve to reinforce brand style and provide a fun user experience.</p>
              <br>
              <p>With a concept in place, I began to develop my idea through sketches, wireframes and static mockups, which were later converted into a semi-functional, clickable prototype demonstrating the flow of the app. Spanning a gamut of tools/resources, from pen and paper to Sketch and Invision, the <em>Coffee App</em> project was a crash course in process-driven design.</p>
